# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Sorting Tool

### Stage 1/6: Numbers only

I decided to make the changelog for the project an actual changelog, and put my thoughts and rambling here, in the changeblog!
I think it's a fun name, though i'm sure someone will look here instead of seeing the changelog. Sorry!

Easy enough start.
"Take input until EOF" and then "print out data about the data"
I steered from the purpose of the course a bit, by not limiting myself to only reading Ints.
But considering they didn't also give me information on what to do with non-Int input, I don't think it matters.
Plus I'm going to need to read non-Int input soon anyhow, so this is... planning ahead!

A tradeoff though is that if you enter things that are not Ints to the input, they'll be captured and counted as ints for the "there are X numbers" output.

I think it'll be okay.
