# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Sorting Tool

This is the 7th project I am completing as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a hard difficulty project. The goal is to make a sorting tool to process and sort data.

I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
