# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Sorting Tool

This was the 7th project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a hard difficulty project. The goal is to make a sorting tool to process and sort data.

The tool takes the following arguments:

<pre>
-inputFile
-outputFile
-dataType [ <b>word</b> / line / long ]
-sortingType [ <b>natural</b> / byCount ]
</pre>

Default values for arguments are in bold


The program reads input from either the input file or console until the EOF is reached.
The input is then sorted either naturally or by count for each input value.
The sorted list is written to the output file or to the console if none was specified. 

I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
